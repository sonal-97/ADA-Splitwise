"Gone on a trip and struggled to split expenses? This project helps optimize transactions and settle debts efficiently. Using heaps and graph visualization (Vis.js), it minimizes transactions and clearly shows cash flowâ€”like Splitwise, but smarter!"
# Splitwise-Like Expense Optimizer

## Overview

When you go on trips or share expenses with friends, settling who owes what can be a nightmare. Instead of manually calculating transactions, this project helps optimize payments using **heaps** and **graph visualization (Vis.js)**. It minimizes transactions and provides a clear, visual representation of how money should be settled.

## Features

- ðŸ“Œ **User Input Based Transactions** â€“ Add people and transactions manually.
- ðŸ”„ **Optimized Debt Settlement** â€“ Reduces the number of transactions required to settle all debts.
- ðŸ“Š **Graphical Representation** â€“ Uses **Vis.js** to visualize transactions before and after optimization.
- âš¡ **Efficient Algorithm** â€“ Uses **binary heaps** to quickly compute the minimum transactions needed.

## How It Works

1. **Enter the number of people** involved in the transactions.
2. **Input debts** by specifying who owes whom and how much.
3. **Optimize transactions** with a single click, reducing unnecessary payments.
4. **View the results** in a graph format, showing the optimized transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ Handles input processing and logic.
- **Vis.js** â€“ Renders the transaction graphs.
- **Binary Heap Data Structure** â€“ Efficiently optimizes transactions.
- **HTML & CSS (Bootstrap)** â€“ Creates a user-friendly UI.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonal-97/splitwise-optimizer.git
   cd splitwise-optimizer
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser.
3. **Enter transactions** and click **"Optimize Transactions"** to view the optimized graph.

## Future Enhancements

- âœ… Add a backend to store transaction history.
- âœ… Implement user authentication.
- âœ… Introduce currency conversion for international trips.
